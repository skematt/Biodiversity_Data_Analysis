# Biodiversity_Data_Analysis
 
In this project, I have incorporated several data analysis mechanisms to find trends among biodiversity of different national parks. Things included are:
- Dataframe manipulations
- Exploratory data analysis through visualizations
- Analysis with summary statistics
- Hypothesis testing of categorical and continuous data
